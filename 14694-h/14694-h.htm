    <h2>CONFESSIONS OF A DUFFER.</h2>

    <h3>No. IX.&mdash;THE DUFFER DEER-STALKING.</h3>

    <p>I am in favour of Mr. BRYCE's Access to Mountains Bill, and
    of Crofters who may be ambitious to cultivate the fertile
    slopes of all the Bens in Scotland. In fact, I am in favour of
    anything that will, or may, interfere with the tedious toil of
    Deer-stalking. Mr. BRYCE's Bill, I am afraid, will do no good.
    People want Access to Mountains when they cannot get it; when
    once they can, they will stay where the beer is, and not go
    padding the wet and weary hoof through peat-hogs, over rocks,
    and along stupid and fatiguing acclivities, rugged with
    heather. Oh, preserve me from Deer-stalking; it is a sport of
    which I cherish only the most sombre memories.</p>

    <p>They may laugh, and say it was my own fault, all my
    misfortune on the stalk, but a feeling reader will admit that I
    have merely been unlucky. My first adventure, or misadventure
    if you like, was at Cauldkail Castle, Lord GABERLUNZIE's place,
    which had been rented by a man who made a fortune in patent
    corkscrews. The house was pretty nearly empty, as everyone had
    gone south for the Leger, so it fell to my lot to go out under
    the orders of the head stalker. He was a man of six foot three,
    he walked like that giant of iron, TALUS his name was, I think,
    who used to perambulate the shores of Crete, an early mythical
    coast-guard. HUGH's step on the mountain was like that of the
    red deer, and he had an eye like the eagle's of his native
    wastes.</p>

    <div class="figright"

        <a href="images/229-1.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/229-1.png"
             alt="'I had been bitten by an Adder.'" /></a>"I had
             been bitten by an Adder."
    </div>

    <p>It was not pleasant, marching beside HUGH, and I was often
    anxious to sit down and admire the scenery, if he would have
    let me. I had no rifle of my own, but one was lent me, with all
    the latest improvements, confound them! Well, we staggered
    through marshes, under a blinding sun, and clambered up cliffs,
    and sneaked in the beds of burns, and crawled through bogs on
    our stomachs. My only intervals of repose were when HUGH lay
    down on his back, and explored the surrounding regions with his
    field-glass. Even then I was not allowed to smoke, and while I
    was baked to a blister with the sun, I was wet through with
    black peat water. Never a deer could we see, or could HUGH see,
    rather, for I am short-sighted, and cannot tell a stag from a
    bracken bush.</p>

    <p>At last HUGH, who was crawling some yards ahead, in an
    uninteresting plain, broken by a few low round hillocks,
    beckoned to me to come on. I writhed up to him, where he lay on
    the side of one of those mounds, when he put the rifle in my
    hand, whispering "Shoot!"</p>

    <p>"Shoot what?" said I, for my head was not yet above the
    crest of the hillock. He only made a gesture, and getting my
    eye-glass above the level, I saw quite a lot of deer, stags,
    and hinds, within fifty yards of us. They were interested,
    apparently, in a party of shepherds, walking on a road which
    crossed the moor at a distance, and had no thoughts to spare
    for us. "Which am I to shoot?" I whispered.</p>

    <p>"The big one, him between the two hinds to the left." I took
    deadly aim, my heart beating audibly, like a rusty pump in a
    dry season. My hands were shaking like aspen leaves, but I got
    the sight on him, under his shoulder, and pulled the trigger.
    Nothing happened, I pulled the trigger of the second barrel.
    Nothing occurred. "Ye have the safety-bolts in," whispered
    HUGH, and he accommodated that portion of the machinery, which
    I do not understand. Was all this calculated to set a man at
    his ease? I took aim afresh, pulled the trigger again. Nothing!
    "Ye're on half-cock," whispered HUGH, adding some remark in
    Gaelic, which, of course, I did not understand. Was it my
    fault? It was not my own rifle, I repeat, and the hammers, at
    half-cock, looked as high as those of my gun, full-cocked.</p>

    <p>All this conversation had aroused the attention of the deer.
    Off they scuttled at full speed, and I sent a couple of bullets
    vaguely after them, in the direction of a small forest of horns
    which went tossing down a glade. I don't think I hit anything,
    and HUGH, without making any remark, took the rifle and strode
    off in a new direction. I was nearly dead with fatigue, I was
    wishing Mr. BRYCE and the British Tourist my share of Access to
    Mountains, when we reached the crown of a bank above a burn,
    which commanded a view of an opposite slope. HUGH wriggled up
    till his eyes were on a level with the crest, and got his long
    glass out. After some interval of time, he wakened me, to say
    that if I snored like that, I would not get a shot. Then he
    showed me, or tried to show me, through the glass, a stag and
    three hinds, far off to our right. I did not see them, I very
    seldom see anything that people point out to me, but I thought
    it wise to humour him, and professed my satisfaction. Was I to
    shoot at them? No, they were about half a mile off, but, if I
    waited, they would feed up to us, so we waited, HUGH nudging me
    at intervals to keep me awake. Meanwhile I was practising
    aiming at a distant rock, about the place where I expected to
    get my shot, as HUGH instructed me. I thought the wretched
    rifle was at half-cock, and I aimed away, very conscientiously,
    for practice. Presently the rifle went off with a bang, and I
    saw the dust fly on the stone I had been practising at. It had
    not been at half-cock, after all; warned by my earlier
    misfortunes, HUGH had handed the rifle to me cocked. The stag
    and the hinds were in wild retreat at a considerable distance.
    I had some difficulty in explaining to HUGH, how this accident
    had occurred, nor did he seem to share my satisfaction in
    having hit the stone, at all events.</p>

    <p>We began a difficult march homewards, we were about thirteen
    miles now from Cauldkail Castle. HUGH still, from habit, would
    sit down and take a view through that glass of his. At last he
    shut it up, like WELLINGTON at Waterloo, and said, "Maybe ye'll
    be having a chance yet, Sir." He then began crawling up a slope
    of heather, I following, like the Prophet's donkey. He reached
    the top, whence he signalled that there was a shot, and passed
    the rifle to me, cocked this time. I took it, put my hand down
    in the heather&mdash;felt something cold and slimy, then
    something astonishingly sharp and painful, and jumped to my
    feet with a yell! I had been bitten by an adder, that was all!
    Now, was <i>that</i> my fault? HUGH picked up the rifle, bowled
    over the stag, and then, with some consideration, applied
    ammonia to my finger, and made me swallow all the whiskey we
    had.</p>

    <p>It was a long business, and Dr. MACTAVISH, who was brought
    from a hamlet about thirty miles away, nearly gave me up. My
    arm was about three feet in circumference, and I was very ill
    indeed. I have not tried Deer-stalking again; and, as I said, I
    wish the British Tourist joy of his Access to Mountains.</p>

        <h3>A BIRD OF PREY.</h3>

        <p>[Despite the laudable endeavours of "The Society for the
        Protection of Birds," the harpy Fashion appears still, and
        even increasingly, to make endless holocausts of small fowl
        for the furnishing forth of "feather trimmings" for the
        fair sex. We are told that to obtain the delicate and
        beautiful spiral plume called the "Osprey," the old birds
        "are killed off in scores, while employed in feeding their
        young, who are left to starve to death in their nests by
        hundreds." Their dying cries are described as
        "heartrending." But they evidently do not rend the hearts
        of our fashionable ladies, or induce them to rend their
        much-beplumed garments. Thirty thousand black partridges
        have been killed in certain Indian provinces in a few days'
        time to supply the European demand for their skins. One
        dealer in London is said to have received, as a single
        consignment, 32,000 dead humming-birds, 80,000 aquatic
        birds, and 800,000 pairs of wings. We are told too that
        often "after the birds are shot down, the wings are
        wrenched off during life, and the mangled bird is left to
        die slowly of wounds, thirst, and starvation."]</p>

        curiosity. The majority of the visitors are of the feminine
        sex, and appear to have come up from semi-detached villas
        in the less fashionable suburbs; but there is also a
        sprinkling of smart and Superior Persons, prosperous City
        Merchants, who regard pictures with respect, as a paying
        investment, young Commercial Men, whose feeling for Art is
        not precisely passionate, but who have turned in to pass
        the time, and because the Exhibition is gratuitous, earnest

    <h2>COURT CARDS.</h2>

    <p>A splendid hand is just now held by Mr. ARTHUR CHUDLEIGH,
    Sole Lessee and Manager of the Court Theatre. Full of trumps,
    honours and odd tricks. A perfect entertainment in three
    pieces. You pay your money and you take your choice. You can
    come in at 8:15 and see <i>The New Sub</i>, by SEYMOUR HICKS
    (Brayvo, 'ICKS! and may your success be Hickstraordinary!) or
    at 9:15 for W.S. GILBERT's <i>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern</i>,
    or at 10 for <i>A Pantomime Rehearsal</i>, which, as I remarked
    long ago on seeing it for the first time, might last for ever
    if only judiciously refreshed, say once in every three months,
    and on this plan it might continue until it should be played in
    1992 by the great-great-grandchildren of the members of the
    present company.</p>

    <p>There is one charming line in the bill&mdash;a bill which,
    on account of its colour, must be "taken as red"&mdash;not to
    be missed by visitors. It comes immediately after the cast of
    <i>The New Sub</i>; it is this,&mdash;"<i>The Uniforms by
    Messrs. Nathan, Coventry Street</i>." It has a line all to
    itself, which is, most appropriately, "a thin red line." Now
    the officers in the programme are given as belonging to the
    "<i>&mdash;&mdash;shire Regiment</i>" <i>i.e.</i>, Blankshire
    Regiment, but as they are all wearing the Nathan uniform, why
    not describe them as officers of the Nathanshire Regiment?
    Perhaps such a title might be more suggestive of Sheriff's
    Officers than of those belonging to Her Majesty's Army; yet, as
    these gallant <i>Dramatis Personæ</i> are avowedly wearing
    NATHAN's uniform (which may they never, never disgrace!) why
    should they not bear the proud title of "The First Royal
    Coventry Street Costumiers"? Let those most concerned see to
    it: our advice is gratis, and, at that price, valuable.</p>

    <p>9:15. <i>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern</i>. Excellent piece
    of genuine fun. If Mr. W.S. GILBERT could be induced to add to
    it, I am sure it would stand an extension of ten minutes to
    allow <i>Hamlet</i> to return and have a grand combat with the
    King, and then for all the characters to be poisoned by
    mistake, and so to end happily.</p>

    <p>To everyone who does not look upon SHAKSPEARE's work as
    "Holy Writ," the question must have occurred, why did the
    Divine WILLIAMS put his excellent rules and regulations for
    play-actors into the mouth of a noble amateur addressing
    distinguished members of "<i>the</i> Profession"? Imagine some
    royal or noble personage telling HENRY IRVING how to play
    <i>Cardinal Wolsey</i>, or instructing Sir FREDERICK LEIGHTON
    in painting, or telling J.L. TOOLE how to "get his laughs"!
    Probably actor and artist would listen in courtier-like silence
    to the illustrious lecturer, just as SHAKSPEARE makes his
    players behave when <i>Hamlet</i> is favouring them with his
    views on the histrionic art. In Mr. GILBERT's skit the leading
    Player makes a neat retort, and completely shuts up
    <i>Hamlet</i>,&mdash;who, being mad, deserves to be "shut
    up,"&mdash;much to the delight of King and Court. But, the
    question remains, why did SHAKSPEARE ever put this speech to
    the players in <i>Hamlet's</i> mouth? My theory is, that he did
    not want BURBAGE to play the part, but couldn't help himself,
    and so, out of pure revenge, he introduced this speech in which
    he makes BURBAGE himself condemn all his own faults. Later on
    the <i>Queen</i> describes <i>Hamlet</i> as "fat and scant of
    breath," which certainly was not the author's ideal Prince of
    Denmark; and this is evidently interpolated as "a nasty one"
    for BURBAGE. At the Court Theatre the skit is capitally played
    all round, though I confess I should have preferred seeing
    <i>Hamlet</i> made up as a sort of fat and flabby
    <i>Chadband</i> puffing and wheezing,&mdash;an expression, by
    the way, that suggests another excellent performer in this
    part, namely, Mr. HERMANN WHEEZIN', who might be induced to
    appear after a lot of "puffin'."</p>

    <p>Finally, <i>A Pantomime Rehearsal</i> is still about the
    very funniest thing to be seen in any London Theatre at the
    present time. The ladies are, all of them, as the old gentleman
    in <i>Pink Dominoes</i> used to say, "Pretty dears!" They dance
    charmingly, especially Miss ELLALINE TERRISS and Miss DECIMA
    MOORE, whose two duets and character-dances are things of joy
    for ever. The representative of <i>Jack Deedes</i>,
    Barrister-at-Law and Gifted Author, is LITTLE and good, and the
    services of Mr. DRAYCOTT as the Lime-Light Comedian are
    invaluable. WEEDON GROSSMITH and BRANDON THOMAS are better than
    ever: their duet is immense, but their combat is too short. Why
    not introduce a <i>Corsican Brothers</i> duel? The music, by
    Mr. EDWARD JONES, is thoroughly appropriate and very catching.
    By the way, one of the songs most encored goes with the
    exquisitely sensible and touching refrain of "Diddle doddle
    diddle chip chop cho choorial li lay," which was enormously
    popular about thirty years ago when it was sung at EVANS's by
    SAM COWELL, and by CHARLES YOUNG as <i>Dido</i> on the stage of
    the St. James's Theatre. Odd this! The air has been a bit
    altered, but I thought that comic songs once out of date were
    dead and done for. The success of this is proof to the
    contrary. Will "Ta-ra-ra-boom" achieve a second success in
    1922? Perhaps. A capital entertainment, which has caught on at
    the Court, says</p>

    <p>Writing of the brilliant Boanerges of the Liberal Party, the
    <i>Times</i> says:&mdash;"Sir WILLIAM is the strongest
    stimulant known to the Gladstonian wire-pullers, and his
    appearance is always an indication that the vital energies of
    the patient are low. It is well understood that his proper
    place is by his own fireside, and that his true function is to
    evolve epigrams and construct original systems of finance in
    that calm retreat.... But whenever they feel particularly
    downcast and unhappy, they break in upon his fecund
    meditations, and get him to fire off a roystering speech."</p>

    <p>This affectionate and admiring tribute from the Thunderer to
    its old favourite contributor "HISTORICUS," is worthy of
    celebrating in deathless verse. How well a dithyramb on the

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <h3>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h3>

    <p><i>House of Commons. Monday, May 2</i>.&mdash;"Would that
    midnight or Closure would come!" murmured Prince ARTHUR just
    now, looking wearily up at clock.</p>

    <p>It is only eleven; still another hour; hard even for trained
    nerves. For more than six hours been discussing Scotch
    Equivalent Grant. CLARK's musical voice has floated through the
    House by the half hour.</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:30%;">
        <a href="images/238-2.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/238-2.png"
             alt="'Curling himself up with delight.'" />
             </a>"Curling himself up with delight."
    </div>

    <p>"A bagpipe with bronchitis nothing to it," says FARQUHARSON,
    curling himself up with delight as he hears sounds that remind
    him of his mountain home. HUNTER has relentlessly pursued the
    unhappy LORD-ADVOCATE, and CALDWELL has thoroughly enjoyed
    himself. His life, it will be remembered, was temporarily
    blighted by action of ROBERTSON when he was Lord-Advocate. Got
    up, following CALDWELL in debate, and dismissed a subject in a
    quarter of an hour's speech without reference to oration
    hour-and-half long with which CALDWELL had delighted House.
    Don't remember what the subject was, but never forget
    CALDWELL's seething indignation, his righteous anger, his
    withering wrath. ROBERTSON smiled in affected disregard; but
    very soon after he found it convenient to withdraw from the
    focus of CALDWELL's eye, and take refuge on the Scotch Bench.
    As for CALDWELL, he withdrew his support from Ministers, tore
    up his ticket of membership as a Unionist, and returned to the
    Gladstonian fold. A tragic story which SCOTT might have worked
    up into three volumes had he been alive. He is not, but
    CALDWELL is, and so are we&mdash;at least partially after this
    six hours' talk round rates in Scotland, whether at ten
    shillings per head or twelve shillings. At half past eleven
    human nature could stand it no longer; progress reported
    although there still remained half-an-hour available time.</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Scotch Members avenged
    Culloden.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:20%;">

    </div>

    <p><i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;"Rather a mean thing for MARJORIBANKS
    to bolt in this way, don't you think?" said CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN,
    walking out of House when SINCLAIR showed signs of following
    CALDWELL. "Says he has some County Council meeting in Scotland.
    Went off by train last night; promised to be back on Thursday.
    We'll see. When he made that arrangement he thought Scotch Bill
    would be through to-night; but it won't. Will certainly go over
    to Thursday. So Master MARJORIBANKS will find himself caught
    when he comes back. Meanwhile he's escaped to-day and some
    hours of last night, which is something. As for me, I've stuck
    to my post, and will very probably die at it. Go in and listen
    to SINCLAIR, dear boy, following CALDWELL, succeeded by
    ESSLEMONT. with CLARK in reserve. I think you'll enjoy
    yourself."</p>

    <p>So I did; thoroughly pleasant afternoon from two o'clock to
    seven. LORD-ADVOCATE visibly growing leaner in body, greyer in
    face. CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN's usually genial temperament souring,
    as will be observed from remarks quoted above. J.B. BALFOUR
    looking in from Edinburgh professes thoroughly to enjoy the
    business. But then he's fresh to it. Pretty large attendance of
    Members, but reserve themselves solely for Division. When bell
    rings three hundred odd come trooping in to follow the Whips
    into either lobby; then troop forth again. Long JOHN O'CONNOR
    beams genially down on scene.</p>

    <p>"Glad you're having this for a change," he says. "You
    grumble when we Irish take the floor. Now the Scotch will
    oblige. Hope you'll like Caledonian and CALDWELL better than
    Home Rule and Erin G. O'BRIEN."</p>

    <p>"Yes, I do," I boldly answered. Only distraught between
    conflicting charms of CALDWELL and SINCLAIR. There is a cold
    massivity about SINCLAIR, a pointedness of profile, when he
    declares "the Nose have it." But there is a loftiness about
    CALDWELL's tone, a subdued fire in his manner when he is
    discussing the difference between a rate of ten shillings and
    one of twelve, a withering indignation for all that is false or
    truculent (in short, anything connected with the office of
    Lord-Advocate) that strangely moves the listener. The very
    mystery of his ordinary bearing weaves a spell of enchantment
    around him. For days and weeks he will sit silent, watchful,
    with his eye on the paralysed Scotch Law Officers. Then,
    suddenly, as in this debate on the Equivalent Grant, he comes
    to the front, and pours forth an apparently inexhaustible flood
    of argumentative oratory, delivered with exhilarating
    animation. "Give me Peebles for pleasure," said the loyal
    Lowlander home from a fortnight's jaunt in Paris. "Give me
    CALDWELL for persuasive argument," says PLUNKET, himself a born
    orator who has missed scarcely five minutes of this two days'
    debate.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page239"

    <p>Curious how influence of the hour permeates and dominates
    everything, even to the distant Lake Ny'yassa. Question asked
    when House met as to how things were going on there under
    Commissioner JOHNSTON. No one at all surprised when, in reply,
    LOWTHER referred to the "two powerful Chiefs, JUMBE and
    MCPONDA." Should like to hear the views of the last gentleman
    on the Scotch Equivalent Grant, its application to secondary
    education in Scotland, and the probable ultimate destination of
    the £25,000 allotted to parochial boards.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday</i>.&mdash;May Day passed off quietly enough;
    but you can't have air charged with electricity, and your
    back-cellars filled with dynamite, without danger of explosion.
    Burst to-day in unlooked-for place, in unexpected
    circumstances. HALDANE brought in Bill providing that
    ratepayers should share with Duke of WESTMINSTER and other
    great landowners benefit of unearned increment. Prospect
    alluring, but debate not exhilarating. House nearly empty;
    ASQUITH delivering able but not exciting speech in favour of
    Bill. Just sort of time and circumstances when, in another
    place, Judge might be expected to fall asleep on Bench. Citizen
    ROBERT GALNIGAD BONTINE CUNINGHAME GRAHAM, sitting on Bench
    behind ASQUITH, listening like the rest of us to his
    well-ordered argument. The Citizen a little tired with Sunday's
    peregrination. Been walking about all day with stout stick in
    hand, and blood-red handkerchief in pocket, ready for any
    emergency. At favourable moment blood-red handkerchief would
    flash forth, tied on to stick with timely twine, and there's
    your flag! Republic proclaimed; Citizen GRAHAM first President,
    under title GALNIGAD I., and before Secretary-of-State MATTHEWS
    quite knew where he was, he would be viewing the scene from an
    elevated position pendant in Trafalgar Square.</p>

    <p>Chance had not come; GRAHAM still plain Citizen, in House of
    Commons listening to commonplace proposals about unearned
    increment. This evidently wouldn't do. Suddenly jumped up;
    shook fist at back of ASQUITH's unoffending head, and, <i>à
    propos de bottes</i>, "wanted to know about the swindling
    companies and their shareholders?"</p>

    <p>ASQUITH really hadn't been saying anything about them;
    turning round beheld Citizen GRAHAM glaring upon him, throwing
    about his arms as if he were semaphore signalling to the
    rearguard of Republican Army.</p>

    <p>"Order! Order!" cried SPEAKER, sternly.</p>

    <p>"Oh, you can suspend me if you like," said Citizen GRAHAM,
    airily, as if it were no hanging matter. Members angrily joined
    in cry of "Order! Order!" SPEAKER promptly "named" the
    Citizen&mdash;not with his full list of names, for time was
    pressing.</p>

    <p>"Name away!" roared the Citizen, whom nothing could
    disconcert. HOME SECRETARY having no fear of the lamppost
    before his eyes, formally moved that the Citizen be suspended.
    GRAHAM snapped his fingers at HOME SECRETARY. "Suspend away!"
    he shouted.</p>

             uplifting."
    </div>

    <p>Members looked on aghast. ROWLANDS standing at the Bar,
    conscious of his hair slowly uplifting. Belonged to the
    advanced guard himself; but this going little too far. LUBBOCK,
    sitting near Citizen, strategically attempted to change the
    conversation. "Did you ever," he said, blandly, "notice how the
    queen bee, when she is&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Oh, you bee &mdash;&mdash;" said the Citizen, roughly
    shaking off the gentle Bee-master.</p>

    <p>SAM SMITH shudderingly covered his face with his hands. "I'm
    so afraid," he whispered, "of the old A-dam coming out." And it
    did, Citizen GRAHAM himself immediately after going out,
    stopping at the Bar to shuffle through a few steps of the
    Carmagnole, and trumpet defiance on his blood-red
    handkerchief.</p>

    <p>After this, a mere flash of lightning through the low clouds
    of a dull afternoon, ASQUITH went on with his speech, debate
    proceeded as if nothing had happened, and HALDANE's Bill thrown
    out by 223 Votes against 148. <i>Business
    done</i>.&mdash;Citizen GRAHAM suspended.</p>

    <p><i>Friday</i>.&mdash;House met to-day as it did yesterday
    and day before to discuss Bills and Motions. But all the talk
    really turns upon date of Dissolution, and what is likely to
    happen after a General Election. SQUIRE OF MALWOOD serenely
    confident in the future.</p>

    <p>"Yes," I said to him to-night, "it must be a great comfort
    to you to reflect that when you come into office you will not
    have to beat about for a programme. You've got your Newcastle
    platform, and I suppose a Liberal Ministry will stand upon
    that."</p>

    <p>"You remind me, dear TOBY," said the Squire, with a far-away
    look, "of a story COLERIDGE brought home from his memorable
    visit to the United States. On his way down to Chicago he went
    out on the platform of the car to breathe the air and look at
    the scenery. 'Come off that,' said the Conductor, following
    him, 'you can't stand on the platform.' 'My good man,' said
    JOHN DUKE&mdash;you know his silver voice and his bland
    manner&mdash;'what is a platform for, if not to stand on?'
    'Platforms,' said the Conductor, sententiously, 'are not made
    to stand on, they are made to get in on.'"</p>

If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

Gutenberg-tm License.

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
